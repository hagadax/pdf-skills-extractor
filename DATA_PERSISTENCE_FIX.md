# Data Persistence Issue Analysis & Fix

## Problem Summary

Your GET-SKILLS application was losing graph and data after some time because:

1. **Stats loading was disabled**: The code to load persisted stats from Azure Blob Storage was commented out
2. **Azure App Service restarts**: When the service restarts (which happens regularly), all in-memory data was lost
3. **No initialization on startup**: The application started with empty data structures every time

## Root Cause

The critical issue was in `app.py` lines 681-683:

```python
# Load stats on application startup (disabled for local testing)
# if __name__ != '__main__':  # Only load when running in production
#     load_stats_from_blob()
```

This meant your application **never loaded existing data on startup**.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enabled Stats Loading on Startup
- Uncommented and fixed the stats loading code
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Stats now load automatically when the application starts

### 2. Added Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Check if stats are loaded and system health
- `/api/reload-stats` - Manually reload stats if needed

### 3. Enhanced Backup System
- Automatic timestamped backups created when processing files
- Better error handling and logging
- Version tracking for future compatibility

### 4. Improved Monitoring
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Health status includes stats information
- Enhanced error reporting

## Additional Recommendations

### Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Upgrade App Service Plan**
   ```bicep
   sku: {
     name: 'S1'  // Instead of B1
   }
   ```
   - Better reliability and "Always On" capability
   - Reduced chance of unexpected restarts

2. **Add Application Insights Alerts**
   - Monitor application restarts
   - Alert when stats are not loaded
   - Track data persistence health

3. **Consider Redis Cache** (Future Enhancement)
   - Add Redis for faster data access
   - Reduce Azure Blob Storage dependency for frequent reads
   - Better performance for real-time stats

### Application Improvements

1. **Periodic Stats Backup**
   ```python
   # Add to your app
   from threading import Timer
   
   def periodic_backup():
       save_stats_to_blob()
       # Schedule next backup in 1 hour
       Timer(3600, periodic_backup).start()
   
   # Start periodic backup
   periodic_backup()
   ```

2. **Database Migration** (Long-term)
   - Consider moving from blob storage to Azure SQL or CosmosDB
   - Better consistency and query capabilities
   - Reduced risk of data loss

## Testing the Fix

1. **Check Health Status**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/health
   ```

2. **Manual Stats Reload** (if needed)
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.azurewebsites.net/api/reload-stats
   ```

3. **Monitor Application Logs**
   - Check Azure App Service logs for startup messages
   - Look for "Stats loaded from blob storage successfully"

## Deployment

After deploying these changes:

1. Your data should persist across application restarts
2. Charts and statistics will reload from Azure Blob Storage
3. You can monitor the health via the `/api/health` endpoint
4. Manual recovery is possible via `/api/reload-stats`

## Prevention for Future

- **Never comment out data loading code** in production
- **Always test persistence** after deployments
- **Monitor application health** regularly
- **Keep backups** of critical data

The main issue has been resolved, and your application should now maintain data persistence across restarts.
