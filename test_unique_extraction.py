    I am proficient in Python programming. I have used Python for web development.
    My Python experience includes Django and Flask frameworks. Python is my favorite language.
    I also know JavaScript and have worked with JavaScript frameworks like React.
    JavaScript is essential for frontend development. I use JavaScript daily.
    
    In my career, I have used Docker containers extensively. Docker helps with deployment.
    Docker is great for microservices. I configure Docker environments regularly.
    
    I also work with AWS cloud services. AWS provides excellent scalability.
    My AWS experience includes EC2, S3, and RDS. AWS is my preferred cloud platform.
